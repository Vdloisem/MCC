# Collaboration Metric between Programming Paradigms

This project implements an innovative metric to assess the collaboration and compatibility between different programming paradigms. Our goal is to provide a quantitative framework to deeply examine the fundamental characteristics, computational capacities, and hierarchical relations among paradigms to identify potential synergies and facilitate effective collaboration.

## Overview of the Metric

The Collaboration Metric (CM) is based on a formal mathematical definition that considers structural characteristics, parent-child relationships, as well as essential computational and behavioral properties of the paradigms. It is designed to offer a quantitative measure of compatibility and collaboration potential by assigning adjustable weights to various factors.

### Metric Formulation

The metric is defined as follows:

MC(P_1, P_2) = α × I(C_1, C_2) + β × R(F_1, S_2) + γ × R(F_2, S_1) + δ × M(M_1, M_2) + ε × TC(T_1, T_2) + ζ × NDO(O_1, O_2)


- **where:**
  - `α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ ∈ [0,1]` and `α + β + γ + δ + ε + ζ = 1`
    - The coefficients α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ are weights assigned to different aspects of the metric, reflecting the relative importance of each factor in the collaboration between paradigms.
  - `P_1` and `P_2` are the programming paradigms being compared.
  - `C_1, C_2` represent the sets of characteristics for paradigms `P_1` and `P_2`, including elements like `{record}`, `{procedure}`, `{closure}`, etc.
  - `F_1, F_2` are the sets of "parent" paradigms for `P_1` and `P_2`, including themselves. These represent the paradigms from which `P_1` and `P_2` have evolved or derived.
  - `S_1, S_2` are the sets of "child" paradigms for `P_1` and `P_2`, including themselves. These are the paradigms that have evolved from `P_1` and `P_2`.
  - `M_1, M_2` are the meta-paradigms associated with `P_1` and `P_2`, which might be `{Functional}`, `{Shared_state}`, etc.
  - `T_1, T_2` indicate Turing-completeness for `P_1` and `P_2`. An indicator is true if the corresponding paradigm is Turing-complete.
  - `O_1, O_2` are the indicators of observable non-determinism for `P_1` and `P_2`. An indicator is true if the paradigm allows for observable non-determinism.

### Functions Used

- **Intersection of Concepts (I):** `I(C_1, C_2) = |C_1 ∩ C_2| / |C_1 ∪ C_2|`
- **Parent-Child Relationship (R):** `R(F, S) = 1 if F ∩ S ≠ ∅, else 0`
- **Meta-paradigm Compatibility (M):** `M(M_1, M_2) = 1 if M_1 = M_2, else 0`
- **Turing-completeness (TC):** `TC(T_1, T_2) = 1 if both T_1 and T_2 are Turing-complete, else 0`
- **Observable Non-determinism (NDO):** `NDO(O_1, O_2) = 1 if O_1 and O_2 either both allow or both do not allow observable non-determinism, else 0`

## Application and Implementation

Our implementation in Haskell calculates this metric by leveraging the language's capabilities to manipulate complex data structures and perform precise mathematical computations. The source code included in this repository demonstrates how we apply the metric to various programming paradigms to assess their collaboration potential.

## How to Use

The directory `MC_Analysis_In_R/` contains R scripts that utilize the results from the Haskell implementation to provide an in-depth analysis and visualizations of the collaboration potentials between paradigms. To start the analysis, make sure you have both Haskell and R installed, then follow the specific instructions in the corresponding subfolders.
