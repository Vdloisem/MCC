# Collaboration Metric between Programming Paradigms

This project implements an innovative metric to assess the collaboration and compatibility between different programming paradigms. Our goal is to provide a quantitative framework to deeply examine the fundamental characteristics, computational capacities, and hierarchical relations among paradigms to identify potential synergies and facilitate effective collaboration.

## Overview of the Metric

The Collaboration Metric (MC) is based on a formal mathematical definition that considers structural characteristics, parent-child relationships, as well as essential computational and behavioral properties of the paradigms. It is designed to offer a quantitative measure of compatibility and collaboration potential by assigning adjustable weights to various factors.

### Metric Formulation

The metric is defined as follows:

MC(P_1, P_2) = α × I(C_1, C_2) + β × R(F_1, S_2) + γ × R(F_2, S_1) + δ × M(M_1, M_2) + ε × TC(T_1, T_2) + ζ × NDO(O_1, O_2)


- **where:**
  - `α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ ∈ [0,1]` and `α + β + γ + δ + ε + ζ = 1`
    - The coefficients α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ are weights assigned to different aspects of the metric, reflecting the relative importance of each factor in the collaboration between paradigms.
  - `P_1` and `P_2` are the programming paradigms being compared.
  - `C_1, C_2` represent the sets of characteristics for paradigms `P_1` and `P_2`, including elements like `{record}`, `{procedure}`, `{closure}`, etc.
  - `F_1, F_2` are the sets of "parent" paradigms for `P_1` and `P_2`, including themselves. These represent the paradigms from which `P_1` and `P_2` have evolved or derived.
  - `S_1, S_2` are the sets of "child" paradigms for `P_1` and `P_2`, including themselves. These are the paradigms that have evolved from `P_1` and `P_2`.
  - `M_1, M_2` are the meta-paradigms associated with `P_1` and `P_2`, which might be `{Functional}`, `{Shared_state}`, etc.
  - `T_1, T_2` indicate Turing-completeness for `P_1` and `P_2`. An indicator is true if the corresponding paradigm is Turing-complete.
  - `O_1, O_2` are the indicators of observable non-determinism for `P_1` and `P_2`. An indicator is true if the paradigm allows for observable non-determinism.

### Functions Used

- **Intersection of Concepts (I):** `I(C_1, C_2) = |C_1 ∩ C_2| / |C_1 ∪ C_2|`
- **Parent-Child Relationship (R):** `R(F, S) = 1 if F ∩ S ≠ ∅, else 0`
- **Meta-paradigm Compatibility (M):** `M(M_1, M_2) = 1 if M_1 = M_2, else 0`
- **Turing-completeness (TC):** `TC(T_1, T_2) = 1 if both T_1 and T_2 are Turing-complete, else 0`
- **Observable Non-determinism (NDO):** `NDO(O_1, O_2) = 1 if O_1 and O_2 either both allow or both do not allow observable non-determinism, else 0`

## Application and Implementation

Our implementation in Haskell calculates this metric by leveraging the language's capabilities to manipulate complex data structures and perform precise mathematical computations. The source code included in this repository demonstrates how we apply the metric to various programming paradigms to assess their collaboration potential.

## Implementation Details

The Haskell codebase is structured into several modules, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the metric calculation process:

### Modules and Their Roles

- **`ParadigmData` and `LanguageData`:** These modules define the programming paradigms and languages, including their characteristics such as concepts, parents, children, Turing-completeness, and observable nondeterminism.

- **`ParadigmType` and `LanguageType`:** Contain type definitions for paradigms and languages. These types are used throughout the code to ensure type-safe operations on data.

- **`MetricFunctions`:** Implements the core functions used to calculate the collaboration metric between paradigms. It includes functions for generating all combinations of paradigms, calculating intersections and unions of characteristics, and computing the metric based on a formal mathematical definition.

- **`MetricFunctionsForLanguages`:** Extends the functionality to calculate the collaboration metric between programming languages. It leverages the paradigm data to assess collaboration potential based on the paradigms supported by each language.

## Detailed Core Functionalities

### Generating Combinations: `combinations`

This function is pivotal for the framework as it generates all possible pairs from a given list of paradigms or languages. Each pair is used as input for metric calculations, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of potential collaboration between every possible combination within the dataset.

### Intersection and Union: `intersection`, `union`

- **`intersection`**: Calculates the common elements between two sets of characteristics, essential for identifying conceptual overlaps. This measure of similarity can indicate potential areas for collaboration.
- **`union`**: Amalgamates the unique elements from two sets, providing insight into the combined characteristics' diversity and complementary nature.

### Calculating the Metric: `calculateMCMetric`

Central to the metric calculation, this function processes two paradigms to compute the Collaboration Metric (CM) based on a sophisticated mathematical formula. Key aspects include:

- **Intersection Over Union (I Function)**: Quantifies conceptual similarity.
- **Parent-Child Relationship (R Function)**: Assesses evolutionary connections, reflecting historical influences or derivations.
- **Meta-paradigm Compatibility (M Function)**: Evaluates shared overarching programming models or philosophies.
- **Turing Completeness (TC Function)** and **Observable Nondeterminism (NDO Function)**: Examine fundamental computational capabilities and behaviors.

This multifaceted score reflects different dimensions of potential collaboration, from conceptual similarity to functional compatibility.

### Writing Results to CSV: `calculateMCForAllCSV`, `calculateLanguageCollaborationForAllCSV`

These functions orchestrate the metric's calculation across all paradigm or language pairs and save the results in CSV format. This approach allows for:

- **Broad Analysis**: By computing and storing metrics for every pair, it highlights areas for promising cross-paradigm integration or language interoperability.
- **Result Sharing**: Exporting to CSV enables sharing findings with the broader community, fostering further exploration and validation.

### Workflow Integration

Seamlessly integrated into the project workflow, these functions are coordinated by the `main` function, which guides the calculation process from generating combinations to writing the comprehensive results to CSV files. This showcases the practical application of mathematical concepts and functional programming in software engineering research.


## How to Use
